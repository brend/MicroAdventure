MicroAdventure Mission Statement
================================

Let's develop a simple game-like experience simulator
using GunCase, the hip new game development framework.

Basics:

 - There is a room, comprised of individual tiles.
   The room fits on the screen entirely; no need
   for scrolling. 
   *Accomplished!*
 - There is a man in the room, Seito-san. 
   *Accomplished!*
 - Seito-san can move in the four cardinal directions,
   from tile to tile. 
   *Accomplished!*
 - While moving, he displays a walking animation. 
   *Accomplished!*
 - Certain tiles are walkable, others are not. 
   Seito-san can only walk on the "floor", not on "walls".
   *Accomplished!*
 - The tiles and Seito-san are displayed in a way
   creating the illusion of depth, i.e. if he walks
   behind a wall, Seito-san will be obscured by it.

Advanced:

 - Seito-san has the burning desire to fix himself
   a bowl of cereal. To this end, he requires
    * a bowl
    * a spoon
    * milk
    * and, of course, a box of his favorite cereal,
      Kaeru-Os
   It should be indicated that he wants to eat cereal
   and needs these ingredients, either through narration,
   on-screen icons, or any other way.
 - Seito-san has an inventory in which the items
   he has already collected show up.
 - Cut scene: When he is prepared for breakfast, 
   he should walk all by himself towards the table, 
   sit down and eat it.

Bonus:
 - Narration using Final Fantasy-style text boxes,
   maybe even with pictures.
